# mk8d-item-randomiser

The game seems to use too many presets in its randomisation of custom items so I made this.

## Building

### Console (terminal-only)
You can build the console version with just gcc (or any c compiler after editing the Makefile) using
`make console`

### GUI
The GUI version requires you to have pkg-config and libgtk4 installed as well.

After that you can build the graphical version using `make graphical`.
